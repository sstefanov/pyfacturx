Factur-X (also called ZUGFeRD in Germany) is a Franco-German standard for
electronic invoices. Structured XML data is embedded in PDF-A/3 files,
allowing invoices to be processed automatically, but still be displayed in
standard PDF readers. Factur-X supports EN 16931, the European standard for
electronic invoicing.

See the [Factur-X website (French)](https://www.factur-x.org/) or
[FeRD website (German)](https://www.ferd-net.de/) for more information.

Currently, this library supports writing XML files according Factur-X Version
1.0.06 (aka ZUGFeRD 2.2) in the profiles up to EN 16931 (Comfort). Generally
in scope of this library, but currently not supported are:

* Extended and XRechnung profiles.
* Reading Factur-X files (XML or PDF).
* Embedding the XML in PDF files.

## Usage

### Generating Factur-X XML

PyFactur-X supports several profiles of Factur-X. First, you need to create
an instance of the correct profile. Then, you can pass that instance to one
of the generation functions.

```python
from datetime import date
from pyfacturx import EN16931Invoice, generate

invoice = EN16931Invoice(
    invoice_number="2021-123",
    invoice_date=date(2021, 4, 13),
    ...  # See the class documentation for all required and optional fields.
)
xml_string = generate(invoice)
```
